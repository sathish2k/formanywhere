  {
    q: "Is my data secure?",
    a: "Absolutely. Data is encrypted both on your device and in transit. Enterprise customers can self-host for complete data control.",

  {
    q: "What happens if I exceed my response limit?",
    a: "You'll receive a notification when approaching your limit. You can upgrade anytime, and local data is never lost.",
