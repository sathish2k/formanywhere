# Figma Design Basics — Condensed Reference

This reference condenses key ideas from Figma’s Design Basics articles that are most relevant to building UI in this repo.

## Visual Hierarchy

- Visual hierarchy is the order of importance in a layout: it guides what people notice first, second, and third.
- Common tools: size, shape, color, position, alignment, and proximity.
- Use contrast to make primary actions or content stand out.
- Use proximity and alignment to clarify relationships and scanning paths.
- Motion and timing can guide attention and indicate state changes.

## Simplicity

- Reduce complexity so the UI feels easier to understand and use.
- Favor conventions over novelty to avoid unnecessary learning curves.
- Use white space to improve clarity and reduce visual noise.
- Avoid over-simplifying when it hurts clarity or removes necessary information.
- Keep flows short by removing steps or splitting dense content across screens.

## Consistency

- Consistency improves usability and learnability by making patterns predictable.
- Keep alignment, spacing, colors, and typography consistent across screens.
- Reuse components and interaction patterns instead of reinventing per feature.

## Using an Existing Design System

- Prefer existing components, patterns, and templates before inventing new ones.
- Benefits include faster design, less decision fatigue, and consistent visuals.

## Reducing Complexity

- Simplify by removing non-essential elements.
- Use shorter, clearer text and reduce redundancy.
- Break complex screens into multiple screens or progressive steps.

## Color Theory (High-Level)

- Use color intentionally to communicate meaning and create emphasis.
- Color relationships (harmony, contrast, temperature) affect readability and mood.
- Use consistent color roles instead of arbitrary color choices.

## Gestalt Principles (High-Level)

- Gestalt principles describe how people group and interpret visual elements.
- Use grouping, alignment, and common regions to make structure obvious.
